# PHP Method Summary

For convenience, all distributions include a stub API reference file that
contains the definitions for all the different methods and constants supported.
The API information is provided in the `couchbase-api.php` file.

## Error Handling

Error handling with the Couchbase PHP interface is currently handled using a
combination of return values, exceptions and error codes. Return values are used
for operations such as `get()`, which returns the corresponding document value
if successful, or `false` if the document could not be found.

An explicit error code system is available when you want to identify specific
errors, but the methods to obtain these must be called immediately after each
operation to identify a specific failure. These methods are deprecated in place
of the PHP exception mechanism and may be removed in a future release.

All the interface calls support exceptions and will raise a specific or generic
Couchbase exception if an operation fails. For more information on the
exceptions supported, see [Exceptions](#api-reference-summary-exceptions).
Operations also raise a result code which can be obtained by calling the
`getResultCode()` method immediately after an operation. Constants are provided
to identify specific error conditions. See [Error Codes and
Constants](#api-reference-summary-errors) for more information.

### Exceptions

Exceptions are used within the PHP Couchbase client library to raise an error
within an operation. The exceptions are all inherited from the base
`CouchbaseException` class, or you can trap for specific exceptions. The error
string associated with the exception will provide more information about the
error.

For example:


```
try {
    $oo->touch("spoon", 1);
} catch (CouchbaseException $e) {
    echo "Error: " + $e;
}
```

The supported exceptions are listed below:

 * **CouchbaseException**

   This is the base class of all of the exceptions thrown from the extension.

 * **CouchbaseIllegalKeyException**

   The key provided to the operation is not legal (i.e. empty).

 * **CouchbaseAuthenticationException**

   Authentication to the Couchbase cluster failed.

 * **CouchbaseLibcouchbaseException**

   An error occurred within libcouchbase which is used by the PHP extension to
   communicate with the cluster.

 * **CouchbaseServerException**

   An error occurred somewhere in the Couchbase Cluster.

### Error Codes and Constants

The PHP client library defines the following error codes and constants. These
can be used against the return value for most operations to determine whether
they succeeded, or failed, and in the event of a failure, what the underlying
cause was. The constants are distributed between both generic interface errors,
and operation specific errors. Check the corresponding API call tables for
information on which errors are raised by each operation.

You can use the `getResultCode()` and `getResultMessage()` methods to obtain the
error code and message for each operation. You can use these in combination with
the error constants to determine a specific course of action when an operation
fails, for example:


```
$cb->replace("fork", "Hello World!", 10);

if ($cb->getResultCode() === COUCHBASE_KEY_ENOENT) {
  // Doesn't exist, add it first
  $cb->add("fork", "Hello World!", 10);
  echo "Key added (didn't exist)\n";
} elseif ($cb->getResultCode() === SUCCESS) {
  echo "Key updated\n";
} else {
  echo "Error occurred: ", $cb->getResultMessage(), "<br/>";
}
```

In the above example, an update operation is attempted on a key which must
already exist. If Couchbase Server returns an error that the key didn't exist,
`add()` is used to create the key. If the operation was successful, we output a
success message. For all other errors, the error message is generated.

The `getResultCode()` and `getResultMessage()` return the error from the
previous API call.

### getResultCode() and getResultMessage() Deprecated

The `getResultCode()` and `getResultMessage()` are deprecated and will be
removed in a future release. The PHP exception system will replace the
functionality of these two methods.
