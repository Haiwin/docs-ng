        Notwithstanding the above, Couchbase Inc. may use Licensee's

        deemed to have been given upon receipt. This Agreement shall be

        excluding its conflicts of law rules. The parties expressly
        agree that the UN Convention for the International Sale of Goods
        (CISG) will not apply. Any legal action or proceeding arising
        under this Agreement will be brought exclusively in the federal
