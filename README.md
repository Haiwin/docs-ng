About
==========
This is a project to build a static documentation website for Couchbase. After checking out a variety of static frameworks, we 
settled on Punch, in NodeJS.

Additional Needs
===============
-Improve left navigation. Items at end disappear when multiple sub-menus are open.
-Something better than Google Custom search, especially for jump-links.
-Input/improvements popout.
-Anything else you can think of to make this a great user and authoring experience.

-Clone this repo

-Get Punch at git@github.com:laktek/punch.git

-Commit and send us a pull request


How to Contribute Content
===========

Experimental features/Labs, other items that have not yet been released:

- For your first paragraph, add the class .labs: <p class="lab"></p>

- Add the text to the paragraph:

"{Description of your feature here, what someone can use it for, benefits of this feature, potential use cases for the feature.} Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry. Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's standard dummy text ever since the 1500s, when an unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to make a type specimen book. It has survived not only five centuries, but also the leap into electronic typesetting, remaining essentially unchanged. This feature is experimental and is not meant for use in production systems. Be aware that you are using it at your own risk. We expect to release the final version of this feature in X.X of Y."
