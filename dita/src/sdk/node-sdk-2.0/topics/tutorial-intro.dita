	<title>Sample app walk-through</title>
	<conbody>
		<p>In this chapter we build on the foundations of the Getting Started guide and build a simple
			web application. Make sure you have the beer-sample bucket installed, because weâ€™ll be
			using it. The sample application will allow you to edit and manage various beers and
			breweries.</p>
		<p>This tutorial is not entirely complete, and leaves some features that remain to be
			implemented. Implementing them is left as an exercise for the reader.</p>
		<p>The full source code for the sample application is available in the beersample-node project
			through couchbaselabs on GitHub.</p>
		<p>Note that the sample application provides more content than described in this tutorial, but
			it should be simple to navigate while reading this tutorial.</p>
