    specify that active and corresponding replica partitions be created on servers that are part of a separate rack or zone. 
    To use and enable Rack Awareness, all servers in a cluster must be upgraded to Couchbase Server Enterprise Edition and minimally, version 2.5. 
    By design, Couchbase Server evenly distributes data of active and replica vBuckets across the cluster for cluster performance and redundancy purposes. 
   With Rack Awareness, server partitions are laid out so the replica partitions for servers in one server group are distributed in servers for a second group and vice versa. 
   If one of the servers becomes unavailable or if an entire rack goes down, data is retained since the replicas are available on the second server group.
