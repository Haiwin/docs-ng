using Secure Socket Layer (SSL) data encryption.
The data replicated between clusters can be encrypted in both uni-directional and bi-directional topologies.</p><p>By default, XDCR traffic to a destination cluster is sent in clear text that is unencrypted.
In this case, when XDCR traffic occurs across multiple clusters over public networks,
it is recommended that a VPN gateway be configured between the two data centers to encrypt the data between each route.</p><p>With the XDCR data encryption feature, the XDCR traffic from the source cluster is secured by
enabling the XDCR encryption option, providing the destination clusterâ€™s certificate, and then replicating.
The certificate is a self-signed certificate used by SSL to initiate secure sessions.</p><p>Data encryption is established between the source and destination clusters.
Since data encryption is established at the cluster level,
all buckets that are selected for replicated on the destination cluster are data encrypted.
For buckets that need to be replicated without data encryption, establish a second XDCR destination cluster
without XDCR data encryption enabled.</p><p><image href="../images/xdcr-ssl.png"/></p><p>Important</p><p>Both data encrypted and non-encrypted replication can not occur between the same XDCR source and
destination cluster. For example, if Cluster A (source) has data encryption enabled to Cluster B (destination), 
then Cluster A (source) cannot also have non-encryption (data encryption is not enabled) to Cluster B (destination).
