  <title>XDCR flush requests</title>
  <shortdesc>Flush requests to delete the entire contents of bucket are not replicated to the remote
    cluster.</shortdesc>
  <body>
    <p> Performing a flush operation will only delete data on the local cluster. Flush is
      disabled if there is an active outbound replica stream configured.</p>
        <note type="important">When replicating to or from a bucket, do not flush that bucket on the source or destination
      cluster. Flushing causes the vBucket state becomes temporarily unaccessible and results in a
      "not_found‚Äù error. The error suspends replication. </note>
