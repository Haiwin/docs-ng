 remote cluster. Performing a flush operation will only delete data on the local
 cluster. Flush is disabled if there is an active outbound replica stream
 configured.</p><p>Important</p><p>When replicating to or from a bucket, do not flush that bucket on  the source or destination cluster. Flushing causes the vBucket state becomes temporarily unaccessible and results in a "not_found‚Äù error. The error suspends replication.
