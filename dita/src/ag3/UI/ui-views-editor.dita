Development View</codeph> button within the <codeph>Views</codeph> section of the Web Console. If you
are creating a new design document and view you will be prompted to supply both
the design document and view name. To create or edit your documents using the
REST API, see the <xref href="../cb-rest-api/#couchbase-views-designdoc-api" format="html">Design Document REST API</xref>.</p><p>To create a new view as part of an existing design document, click the <codeph>Add
View</codeph> button against the corresponding design document.</p><p>View names must be specified using one or more UTFâ€“8 characters. You cannot have
a blank view name. View names cannot have leading or trailing whitespace
characters (space, tab, newline, or carriage-return).</p><p>If you create a new view, or have selected a Development view, you can create
and edit the <codeph>map()</codeph> and <codeph>reduce()</codeph> functions. Within a development view, the
results shown for the view are executed either over a small subset of the full
document set (which is quicker and places less load on the system), or the full
data set.</p><required-cleanup remap="figure"><ph>
<image href="../images/views-editing.png"><alt/></image>
</ph></required-cleanup><p>The top portion of the interface provides navigation between the available
design documents and views.</p><p>The <codeph>Sample Document</codeph> section allows you to view a random document from the
database to help you write your view functions and so that you can compare the
document content with the generated view output. Clicking the <codeph>Preview a Random
Document</codeph> will randomly select a document from the database. Clicking <codeph>Edit
Document</codeph> will take you to the Views editor, see <xref href="#topic9764/couchbase-admin-web-console-documents">Using the Document
Editor</xref></p><p>Documents stored in the database that are identified as Non-JSON may be
displayed as binary, or text-encoded binary, within the UI.</p><p>Document metadata is displayed in a separate box on the right hand side of the
associated document. This shows the metadata for the displayed document, as
supplied to the <codeph>map()</codeph> as the second argument to the function. For more
information on writing views and creating the <codeph>map()</codeph> and <codeph>reduce()</codeph> functions,
see <xref href="#topic9764/couchbase-views-writing">Writing Views</xref>.</p><p>With the View Code section, you should enter the function that you want to use
for the <codeph>map()</codeph> and <codeph>reduce()</codeph> portions of the view. The map function is
required, the reduce function is optional. When creating a new view a basic
<codeph>map()</codeph> function will be provided. You can modify this function to output the
information in your view that you require.</p><p>Once you have edited your <codeph>map()</codeph> and <codeph>reduce()</codeph> functions, you must use the
<codeph>Save</codeph> button to save the view definition.</p><p>The design document will be validated before it is created or updated in the
system. The validation checks for valid JavaScript and for the use of valid
built-in reduce functions. Any validation failure is reported as an error.</p><p>You can also save the modified version of your view as a new view using the
<codeph>Save As...</codeph> button.</p><p>The lower section of the window will show you the list of documents that would
be generated by the view. You can use the <codeph>Show Results</codeph> to execute the view.</p><p>To execute a view and get a sample of the output generated by the view
operation, click the <codeph>Show Results</codeph> button. This will create the index and show
the view output within the table below. You can configure the different
parameters by clicking the arrow next to <codeph>Filter Results</codeph>. This shows the view
selection criteria, as seen in the figure below. For more information on
querying and selecting information from a view, see <xref href="#topic9764/couchbase-views-writing-querying">Querying
Views</xref>.</p><required-cleanup remap="figure"><ph>

the raw, JSON formatted, version of the View results. To access the view results
using the REST API, see the <xref href="../cb-rest-api/#couchbase-restapi-query-views" format="html">REST API, Querying views</xref>.</p><p>By default, Views during the development stage are executed only over a subset
of the full document set. This is indicated by the <codeph>Development Time Subset</codeph>
button. You can execute the view over the full document set by selecting <codeph>Full
Cluster Data Set</codeph>. Because this executes the view in real-time on the data set,
the time required to build the view may be considerable. Progress for building
the view is shown at the top of the window.</p><p>If you have edited either the <codeph>map()</codeph> or <codeph>reduce()</codeph> portions of your view
definition, you <i>must</i> save the definition. The <codeph>Show Results</codeph> button will
remain greyed out until the view definition has been saved.</p><p>You can also filter the results and the output using the built-in filter system.
This filter provides similar options that are available to clients for filtering
results.</p><p>For more information on the filter options, see <xref href="#topic9764/couchbase-views-editor-view">Getting View
Results</xref>.</p><p><!--Removed anchor point couchbase-views-editor-publishing--></p></section><section><title>Publishing views</title><p>Publishing a view moves the view definition from the Development view to a
Production View. Production views cannot be edited. The act of publishing a view
and moving the view from the development to the production view will overwrite a
view the same name on the production side. To edit a Production view, you copy
the view from production to development, edit the view definition, and then
publish the updated version of the view back to the production side.</p><p><!--Removed anchor point couchbase-views-editor-view--></p></section><section><title>Getting view results</title><p>Once a view has been published to be a production view, you can examine and
manipulate the results of the view from within the web console view interface.
This makes it easy to study the output of a view without using a suitable client
library to obtain the information.</p><p>To examine the output of a view, click icon next to the view name within the
view list. This will present you with a view similar to that shown in the figure
below.</p><required-cleanup remap="figure"><ph>

enter the document ID in the box, and click the <codeph>Lookup Id</codeph> button to load the
specified document.</p><p>To examine the function that generate the view information, use the <codeph>View Code</codeph>
section of the display. This will show the configured map and reduce functions.</p><p>The lower portion of the window will show you the list of documents generated by
the view. You can use the <codeph>Show Results</codeph> to execute the view.</p><p>The <codeph>Filter Results</codeph> interface allows you to query and filter the view results
by selecting the sort order, key range, or document range, and view result
limits and offsets.</p><p>To specify the filter results, click on the pop-up triangle next to <codeph>Filter
Results</codeph>. You can delete existing filters, and add new filters using the
embedded selection windows. Click <codeph>Show Results</codeph> when you have finished
selecting filter values. The filter values you specify are identical to those
available when querying from a standard client library. For more information,
see <xref href="#topic9764/couchbase-views-writing-querying">Querying Views</xref>.</p><p>Due to the nature of range queries, a special character may be added to query
specifications when viewing document ranges. The character may not show up in
all web browsers, and may instead appear instead as an invisible, but
selectable, character. For more information on this character and usage, see
