  <title>Handling replication</title>
  <shortdesc>Data replication is distributed throughout the Couchbase cluster to prevent a single
    point of failure. Data replication is configurable on a bucket-level and node-basis.</shortdesc>
  <body>
    <p>Within a Couchbase cluster, you have <i>replica data</i> which is a copy of an item at
      another node. After writing an item to Couchbase Server, it makes a copy of this data from the
      RAM of one node to another node. Distribution of replica data is handled in the same way as
      active data; portions of replica data will be distributed around the Couchbase cluster onto
      different nodes to prevent a single point of failure. Each node in a cluster will have
        <i>replica data</i> and <i>active data</i>.
      
      Replica data is the copy of data from another
      node while active data is data that had been written by a client on that node.</p>
    
    <p>Replication of data between nodes is entirely peer-to-peer based; information will be
      replicated directly between nodes in the cluster. There is no topology, hierarchy or
      master-slave relationship between nodes in a cluster. When a client writes to a node in the
      cluster, Couchbase Server stores the data on that node and then distributes the data to one or
      more nodes within a cluster. The following shows two different nodes in a Couchbase cluster,
      and illustrates how two nodes can store replica data for one another:</p>

    <p>When a client application writes data to a node, that data will be placed in a replication
      queue and then a copy will be sent to another node. The replicated data will be available in
      RAM on the second node and will be placed in a disk write queue to be stored on disk at the
      second node.</p>
    <p>Notice that a second node will also simultaneously handle both replica data and incoming
      writes from a client. The second node will put both replica data and incoming writes into a
      disk write queue. If there are too many items in the disk write queue, this second node can
      send a <i>backoff message</i> to the first node. The first node will then reduce the rate at
      which it sends items to the second node for replication. This can sometimes be necessary if
      the second node is already handling a large volume of writes from a client application.</p>
    <p>If multiple changes occur to the same document waiting to be replicated, Couchbase Server is
      able to <i>de-duplicate, or ‘de-dup’</i> the item; this means for the sake of efficiency, it
      will only send the latest version of a document to the second node.</p>
    <p>If the first node fails in the system the replicated data is still available at the second
      node. Couchbase can serve replica data from the second node nearly instantaneously because the
      second node already has a copy of the data in RAM; there is no need for the data to be copied
      over from the failed node or to be fetched from disk. Once replica data is enabled at the
      second node, Couchbase Server updates a map indicating where the data should be retrieved, and
      the server shares this information with client applications. Client applications can then get
      the replica data from the functioning node.</p>

    <section><title>Providing data replication</title><p>You can configure data replication for each
        bucket in cluster. You can also configure different buckets to have different levels of data
        replication, depending how many copies of your data you need. For the highest level of data
        redundancy and availability, you can specify that a data bucket will be replicated three
        times within the cluster.</p><p>Replication is enabled once the number of nodes in your
        cluster meets the number of replicas you specify. For example, if you configure three
        replicas for a data bucket, replication will only be enabled once you have four nodes in the
        cluster.</p><p>Note</p><p>After you specify the number of replicas you want for a bucket and
        then create the bucket, you cannot change this value. Therefore be certain you specify the
        number of replicas you truly want.</p>
    </section>
    
    <section><title>Specifying backoff for replication</title>
      
      <p>Your cluster is set up to perform
        some level of data replication between nodes within the cluster for any given node. Every
        node will have both <i>active data</i> and <i>replica data</i>. Active data is all the data
        that had been written to the node from a client, while replica data is a copy of data from
        another node in the cluster. Data replication enables high availability of data in a
        cluster. Should any node in cluster fail, the data will still be available at a
        replica.</p>
      
      <p>On any give node, both active and replica data must wait in a disk write
        queue before being written to disk. If you node experiences a heavy load of writes, the
        replication queue can become overloaded with replica and active data waiting to be
        persisted.</p>
      
      <p>By default a node will send backoff messages when the disk write queue on
        the node contains one million items or 10%. When other nodes receive this message, they will
        reduce the rate at which they send replica data. You can configure this default to be a
        given number so long as this value is less than 10% of the total items currently in a
        replica partition. For instance if a node contains 20 million items, when the disk write
        queue reaches 2 million items a backoff message will be sent to nodes sending replica data.
        You use the Couchbase command-line tool, <codeph>cbepctl</codeph> to change this
        configuration:</p>
      
      <p>In the following example, a node sends replication backoff requests when it has two
        million items or 10% of all items, whichever is greater.</p>
      
      <codeblock>&gt; ./cbepctl 10.5.2.31:11210 -b bucket_name -p bucket_password set tap_param tap_throttle_queue_cap 2000000
</codeblock>
      
      
      <p>In the following example, the default percentage, used to manage the replication stream, is changed.
        If the items in a disk write queue reach the greater of this percentage or a specified
        number of items, replication requests slow down:</p>
      <codeblock>setting param: tap_throttle_queue_cap 2000000
</codeblock>
      
      <p>In the following example, the threshold is set to 15% of all items at a replica node. 
        When a disk write queue on a node reaches this point, it sends replication backoff requests to other
        nodes.</p>
      
      <codeblock>&gt; ./cbepctl  10.5.2.31:11210 set -b bucket_name tap_param tap_throttle_cap_pcnt 15
</codeblock>
      
      <note type="important">Be aware that this tool is a per-node, per-bucket operation. That means
        that if you want to perform this operation, you must specify the IP address of a node in the
        cluster and a named bucket. If you do not provided a named bucket, the server applies the
        setting to any default bucket that exists at the specified node. If you want to perform this
        operation for an entire cluster, perform the command for every node/bucket combination that
        exists for that cluster.</note>
      <p> You can also monitor the progress of this backoff operation in Couchbase Web Console under
        Tap Queue Statistics | back-off rate. </p>
